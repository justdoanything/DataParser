## Logs
I studied [java design pattern](https://github.com/justdoanything/self-study/blob/main/WIS/03%20ApplicationModernization.md#5%EF%B8%8Fâƒ£-java-design-pattern) and tried to apply into this project.

First of all, I need to divide which field and method should be common for all classes. I figured out it by input, output type.\
After that, I thought about how to implement these common fields/methods.

- Builder Pattern
  - There are many fields in each class, and they are different.
  - This pattern makes it easier to create classes.
  - Required fields are defined in constructor.
- Template Pattern
  - All classes have similar fields and methods.
  - Common fields and methods are separated into template class, and what they do is written in each class.
- Factory Pattern
  - To create a lot of classes into one class.

## What Classes Do 
- ### TypeConverter.java
  This class converts an object that has setter/getter to map.
  - (1) Map â†’ Object (VO)
  - (2) Object (VO) â†’ Map

- ### AttributeToFile.java
  This class reads a file and makes table structure data like Excel.
  - ###### ðŸ”° Input
	Name | Attribute Name | Attribute Value
	---|---|---
	TV | Size | 65 inch
	TV | Company | LG
	TV | Quality | HIGH
	Audio | Size | 32
	Audio | Company | Apple
	Audio | Channel	| Dual
  - ###### ðŸ”° Output
    Name | Size	| Company | Quality	| Channel
    ---|---|---|---|---
    TV | 65 inch | LG | HIGH |
    Audio | 32	| Apple	| | Dual

---
 
- ### FileToInsertQuery.java
  This class reads a file and makes insert query format like below.
  - ###### ðŸ”° Input
    Name | Size | Company | Quality | Channel
	---|---|---|---|---
	 TV | 65 inch | LG | HIGH |
	 Audio | 32	| Apple	| | Dual
  - ###### ðŸ”° Output
    1. Bulk Insert Type
	```sql
	INSERT INTO test_table ( Name, Size, Company, Quality, Channel ) VALUES
	('TV', '65 inch', 'LG', 'HIGH' null)
	,('Audio', '32', 'Apple', null, 'Dual'); 
	```
	2. Non-Bulk Insert Type
	```sql
	INSERT INTO test_table ( Name, Size, Company, Quality, Channel ) VALUES ('TV', '65 inch', 'LG', 'HIGH' null);
	INSERT INTO test_table ( Name, Size, Company, Quality, Channel ) VALUES ('Audio', '32', 'Apple', null, 'Dual');
	```

- #### JsonToFile.java
  - ###### ðŸ”° Input
  - ###### ðŸ”° Output

---

- #### FileToJson.java
  - ###### ðŸ”° Input
  - ###### ðŸ”° Output

---

- #### CheckingJson.java
  - ###### ðŸ”° Input
  - ###### ðŸ”° Output

---

- #### ObjectToInsertQuery.java
  This class creates a bulk insert query using an object with local variables.  This is a old way to convert a value object to insert query but you can use if you like old fashion :P
  - ###### ðŸ”° Input
	```java
	// input parameter is List<sampleVO> of size 3
	public class sampleVO {
		private String value1;
		private String value2;
		private String value3;
	}
	```
  - ###### ðŸ”° Output
  	```sql
	INSERT INTO test_table (value1, value2, value3) VALUES
	('test1', 'test2', '111'),
	('test1', 'test2', '111'),
	('test1', 'test2', '111');
	```
